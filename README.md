# Conversation Street BOT for Think Life

Project for leads generation commissioned from the Prince of Gambia.

The project create a Web APP that looks like a converastion but behind the scene is a web form. At the end of the conversation the form is submitted to the CRM LUNAR and the user is redirect to an 'external' `thank-you` page.

The APP can work as single page or be embedded in an existing web page, simply adding an HTML tag and injecting an external JavaScript. This will read and replace the HTML tag with a complex HTML structure (conversation widget) that is controlled and styled by the JavaScript.

We can have many APPs with different questions (`/src/items/..`) or different style.

## Usage

You can use this repo in different way. Here the list for an easy understanding.

### Developer mode

To expand and add functionalities, please run this command and edit in the `/src/` folder. The code will be rebuilt on fly and automatically refreshed on the browser (`http://localhost:8081/conversation-#.html`). This command also start the docker server where is hosted the API (on port 9000).

```
npm run build
```

### Clean all the generate code

Delete all the generated files inside `/dist/`, `/tmp/` and inside the wordpress theme `/web/../dist/`.

```
npm run clean
```

### Rebuild the package

Rebuild all the distribution parts of the package (`/dist/` & `/web/../dist/`). **This task will initially clean (delete) all the previous generated files.**

```
npm run rebuild
```

## API Development

```
npm run docker
```

**Then open in your browser**

# How to use the conversation bot app

The conversation bot can be embedded in any web page just simply adding a special HTML tag and a JavaScript.

```html
<html>
...
<body>
...
<div id="thinklife-conversation-1" data-mcid="15016" data-redirect="/thank-you/"></div>
...
<script defer src="bot/dist/conversation-1.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<div>` tag with `id="thinklife-conversation-1"` will be replace with the conversation bot app that is generated by the JavaScript.

The app will simulate a conversation bot that will ask the user few questions to collect some information that will be submitted to a Lunar CRM campaign. The `campaign ID` can be set in the attribute `data-mcid="15016"`.

On completion the app will redirect to a `/thank-you/` page hosted on the website (not part of the app). This page can be set using the attribute `data-redirect="/thank-you/"`.

NB: The only limitation is that the JavaScript file must be hosted on the same domain (or subdomain) where the `/api/` folder is also hosted. Normally on https://bot.think-life.co.uk/dist/conversation-1.js
